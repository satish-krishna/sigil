# Roadmap

The path to **Sigil v1**: a runnable kernel, one real agent, persistent storage, and a one-command local stack. Issues are listed in completion order, grouped by layer. Items inside the same layer can be developed in parallel; layers stack on their predecessors.

**v1 demonstrates:**
- A kernel (FastEndpoints) that registers agents, stores their advertised skills, and dispatches intents over a signed gateway
- A real out-of-process agent (Echo) authored as a JSON manifest + Claude-style skills + optional C# hooks
- Persistent storage with optimistic concurrency
- `docker compose up` boots the whole stack

Phases beyond v1 (planner, policy engine, observability, JWT/mTLS) are tracked separately in the blueprint's [Phase Plan](.bob/docs/sigil-architecture-blueprint.md#9-phase-plan).

## What v1 delivers

After every issue above is closed:

1. **Kernel boots.** `dotnet run --project src/Sigil.Api` exposes register/deregister/heartbeat/list/intent endpoints over FastEndpoints.
2. **Storage persists.** MongoDB holds agent registrations, audit entries, and context with ETag-based optimistic concurrency.
3. **Agents register.** The Echo agent boots from a JSON manifest, advertises one skill (`echo-input`), heartbeats, and gracefully deregisters on shutdown.
4. **Intents flow end-to-end.** A `POST /api/intents` matches an agent by skill, the gateway POSTs `/sigil/execute` over the signed channel, the agent runs the skill (composing the system prompt, invoking the in-process echo tool), returns a `ContextDelta`, and the audit log records the result.
5. **One command runs the stack.** `docker compose up` builds and starts the kernel container, the Echo agent container, and MongoDB.

## Beyond v1

Per [blueprint §9](.bob/docs/sigil-architecture-blueprint.md#9-phase-plan):

- **Phase 2** — `IPlanner` (Deterministic / LLM / Hybrid), SnapshotEngine, multi-agent execution with delta merging, second sample agent.
- **Phase 3** — Policy pipeline (token budget, tool access, PII masking, checkpoints), JWT issuance, mTLS for the Trusted tier.
- **Phase 4** — OpenTelemetry tracing, structured log ingestion, cost-per-intent metrics, dashboards.
- **Phase 5** — Angular dashboard, agent marketplace concepts, MCP-as-tool-provider integration.
